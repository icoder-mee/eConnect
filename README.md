    ```

3.  Configure the API URL in `src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/environments/environment.development.ts`:

    ```typescript
    // src/environments/environment.development.ts
    export const environment = {
      production: false,
      apiUrl: 'https://localhost:7283/api/', // Adjust port if necessary
